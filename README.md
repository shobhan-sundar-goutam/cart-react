# Cart

Hi ðŸ‘‹ I am Shobhan Sundar Goutam. This is a Cart app where users can increase or decrease the number of items and also can see the total price with respect to the items selected. This is made with the help of `react.js`. This is a static web app.

First I made it using `useState` and `contextAPI` and then rewritten using `useReducer`.
